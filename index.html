        <p>
          I am a sophomore ISAT student with interests in <strong>systems thinking</strong>,
          <strong>sustainability</strong>, and <strong>applied problem-solving</strong>.
          I enjoy translating complex systems into clear, real-world solutions through hands-on projects.

        <h2>Environmental Education &amp; Trail Signage System</h2>
        <p><strong>Eagle Scout Service Project | Fish River Nature Preserve</strong></p>

        <p>
          As a junior in high school, I partnered with the <strong>South Alabama Land Trust (SALT)</strong>
          to design and implement a permanent educational signage system for the Fish River Nature Preserve.
          The objective of the project was to improve visitor understanding of local ecosystems while providing
          clear navigation and educational context throughout the trail.
        </p>

        <p>
          I developed two primary types of signage: <strong>five ecosystem information boards</strong> describing
          the distinct ecological zones within the preserve, and <strong>fifteen plant identification signs</strong>
          highlighting native and invasive species in their natural environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          To ensure accurate placement and long-term usability, I conducted on-site trail walkthroughs to collect
          <strong>GIS location data</strong>. I used this data to create a detailed digital trail map using
          <strong>Google My Maps</strong>, complete with waypoints corresponding to each sign location.
          This map supported both installation planning and future trail management.
        </p>

        <p>
          I coordinated directly with <strong>Pulse Design</strong> to finalize sign layouts, materials,
          and production specifications, prioritizing durability and readability in an outdoor setting.
          Once fabrication was complete, I recruited and led volunteer teams to install the signage along the
          1.6-mile trail, managing logistics, safety, and workflow throughout the installation process.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Project planning &amp; execution</strong> across multiple phases and stakeholders</li>
          <li><strong>Leadership &amp; volunteer coordination</strong> in a real-world outdoor environment</li>
          <li><strong>Stakeholder communication</strong> with land trust staff and design professionals</li>
          <li><strong>GIS data collection &amp; spatial mapping</strong> for trail planning and signage placement</li>
          <li><strong>Public-facing technical communication</strong> for environmental education</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Outcome:</strong>
          Successfully delivered a fully mapped <strong>1.6-mile educational nature trail</strong> featuring
          over <strong>20 professionally designed signs</strong>, including ecosystem interpretation boards
          and plant identification markers. The project enhanced visitor navigation, increased public awareness
          of local ecology and invasive species, and provided SALT with durable, long-term educational infrastructure.
